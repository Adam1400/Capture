User Stories
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a product feature told from the perspective of a potential or existing user who wants that feature.

As a mom, I want to upload my pictures so that I can keep them for memories.

As a college student, I want to see posts from my friends so I can keep up with their lives.

UML Information
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a software engineering language that was developed to create a standard way of visualizing the design of a system. UML Class Diagrams describe the structure of a system by showing the systemâ€™s classes and how they relate to one another.

Class diagrams are the main building block of any object-oriented solution. It shows the classes in a system, attributes, and operations of each class and the relationship between each class.

A class has three parts:

name at the top
attributes in the middle
operations or methods at the bottom
In a large system with many related classes, classes are grouped together to create class diagrams. Different relationships between classes are shown by different types of arrows.

Benefits of class diagrams

Illustrate data models for information systems, no matter how simple or complex.
Better understand the general overview of the schematics of an application.
Visually express any specific needs of a system and disseminate that information throughout the business.
Create detailed charts that highlight any specific code needed to be programmed and implemented to the described structure.
