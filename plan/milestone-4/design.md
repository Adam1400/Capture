### Milestone 4. Functional Requirements

 Role: Designer - Design
 
 Goal: Refactoring and Code Structure
 * Document Existing Design Patterns
 * Draw diagram of code structure
 * Document key APIs
 * Build import/export for data
 
### Existing Design Patterns

Explanation: A design pattern is a general, reusable soultion to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transfmored directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects.

Previously our group has created UML diagrams which can be found [here](https://github.com/Adam1400/cs350/tree/master/plan/milestone-2/design/diagrams)

### Diagram of Code Structure

Our group has created a new code diagram found [here](https://github.com/Adam1400/cs350/tree/master/plan/milestone-4/diagrams/Blank%20diagram%20(5).jpeg)

### Document Key API's

Explanation: An API key or application programming interface key is a code that gets passed in by computer applications. The program or application then calls the API or application programming interface to identify its user, developer or calling program to a website. 

[Here](https://github.com/Adam1400/cs350/tree/master/plan/milestone-4/diagrams/api_keys_overview.png) is an image to help further understand this concept.
