## Team communication
All main communication will be done throught the Discord on the server

## Plan daily meetings
For our group we have been meeting either before or after each class. During these group meetings we discuss any questions that we have first or just check that we're all on track. These meetings are either through the text channel or voice channel depending on everyones availability. Any addtional meetings are schedueled if necessary
- Everyone is on track, getting their individual jobs done
- Communication via Discord has been done well

## Document Sharing
* Refine the organization of documents
* Build one library or tutorials
* Start simple but pay as you go
### Updated Document Library (Can be found here)
* [Documents](https://github.com/Adam1400/cs350/tree/master/docs/documents.md)
