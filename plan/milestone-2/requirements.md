## Capture - Setup communications

### Configure communication tools
For our communication tool we are using a Discord server that we setup since the beginning of the semester. On the discord server we have two text channels; one for general communication and one for important links. We also have a voice channel for voice chat. Any additional channels will be added if needed in the future.

### Team communication
All main communication will be done throught the Discord on the server.

### Plan daily meetings
For our group we have been meeting either before or after each class. During these group meetings we discuss any questions that we have first or just check that we're all on track. These meetings are either through the text channel or voice channel depending on everyones availability. Any addtional meetings are schedueled if necessary.
