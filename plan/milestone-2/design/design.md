## Capture - Software Architecture

### User Stories
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a product feature told from the perspective of a potential or existing user who wants that feature.

* As a mom, I want to upload my pictures so that I can keep them for memories.

* As a college student, I want to see posts from my friends so I can keep up with their lives.

### UML Information

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a software engineering language that was developed to create a standard way of visualizing the design of a system. UML Class Diagrams describe the structure of a system by showing the systemâ€™s classes and how they relate to one another.

Class diagrams are the main building block of any object-oriented solution. It shows the classes in a system, attributes, and operations of each class and the relationship between each class.

A class has three parts: 
- name at the top
- attributes in the middle 
- operations or methods at the bottom 

In a large system with many related classes, classes are grouped together to create class diagrams. Different relationships between classes are shown by different types of arrows.

Benefits of class diagrams

* Illustrate data models for information systems, no matter how simple or complex.
* Better understand the general overview of the schematics of an application.
* Visually express any specific needs of a system and disseminate that information throughout the business.
* Create detailed charts that highlight any specific code needed to be programmed and implemented to the described structure.
