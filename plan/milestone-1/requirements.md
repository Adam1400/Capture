## Capture

Capture is an application which will allow users to upload pictures and interact with those of others.

Registered users do not necessarily need to follow the people they like photos from as this application will be based on a public forum. 
This allows for less separation and more diversity for our users.

### Business proposition

Business Value

This application will be capable of supporting multiple users at once, which will be key when the number of users begins to increase exponentially.

### Project scope & budget

#### Schedule, Money, Features

There are three primary priorities that define the scope of a software project.  It is 
important to establish the priority of each of these.  

Picture Builder Priorities

1. Schedule - This entire must be completed by December 4, 2020 in order to be used for the
UNC classes.
2. Money - This project will be the team effort of Jessica Torres, Allen Adams, Jess Herold, and Chris Hogue so no actual money will
be spent. 
3. Features - Essential features define the 
Minimum Viable Product. Required features mark the Minimum Desirable Project.  Desired 
features define the Luxury Project.

Features will be adjusted throughout the milestone and must be constantly
negotiated with the client.


#### Project Features

User Experience

Users of Capture will have a user sign in, commenting feature, the ability to post pictures, and like other photos.


### Teamwork

Communication Plan

The Capture team will meet MWF each week at 1:10-1:45 to coordinate 
project activities.  Development work will be done outside of this meeting.
This will serve the
purpose of the "Scrum Daily Stand-up Meeting".

Meeting Agenda

In this coordination each member will answer three questions.

* What did I do?
* What am I working on next?
* What challenges or risks are before me?

This meeting is for coordination only.  Developers should follow up and collaborate
later with each other when they see opportunities.

Team Coordination

The person with the Requirement Role will be in charge of leading the meeting and ensuring members know what they need to accomplish.

Sprints

Each milestone represents a development sprint, which will be a highly focused burst 
of energy to meet the milestone goals.  Each sprint will last for two weeks.

During the Sprint developers will be building the next version of the product.  They will
be working on an explicit list of features designated by the client.  All other activities
will be postponed until the Sprint is complete.  Features that are planned cannot change 
during the Sprint.

Sprint Planning meetings

Each Sprint will start with a Sprint Planning Meeting.  Development team will meet with 
the client to determine the client features with the highest priority.  This will be 
expressed as a Product Backlog which shows the features in sorted order of importance to 
the client.

For each Milestone developers will
commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in the two-week 
Development Sprint.  Features are selected by the individual developer and must include 
the highest priority issues on the Product Backlog.

If a developer cannot deliver the required functionality then another teammate will be 
required to produce the missing result.
