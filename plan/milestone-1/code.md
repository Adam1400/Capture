### Setting UP Github Pages Repository 
* Your website’s files will live in a repository named username.github.io (where “username” is your actual GitHub user name). To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab.
* If you scroll down on the settings page, you’ll see the GitHub Pages section near the bottom. Click the Choose a theme button to start the process of creating your site.
* Once you’ve clicked the button, you’ll be directed to the Theme Chooser. You’ll see several theme options in a carousel across the top of the page. Click on the images to preview the themes. Once you’ve selected one, click Select theme on the right to move on. It’s easy to change your theme later, so if you’re not sure, just choose one for now.
* Once you’re finished editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Commit changes.

### Publishing Project Docs
Project docs will be published via Github through the use of Markdown. 

### User Guide for Dev Workflow
RAD (Rapid Application Development)
Rapid Prototyping
* Prototype: translating ideas into visual and functional representations with a prototyping tool such as Justinmind.
* Review: share the prototype with target user groups, stakeholders and your team to evaluate the visual and interactive characteristics.
* Refine: use feedback from the review stage to perform iterations that intend to make a truer, more polished replica of the end product.
