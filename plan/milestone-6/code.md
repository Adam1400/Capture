### CORE FEATURES
All main features and implememnted and should be adiquite for a relase. The application serves its purpose and does everything a picture app should. Will present well for class demo next week.

### STABILITY
The application is currently in a stable state (on heroku). Its ready for a release! The only issues in terms of stabiulity is the speed it loads the front page... unfortunatly there is not alot we can do to speed up load times. That is determined by heroku and AWS. In the future we could implememnt a little splash screen that plays as the app starts. IT could act as a loading screen and it would hide the bad loading of pics. 

### BUGS 
This current release is stable on heroku. However the current build in development is a little buggy. Current inpmementation of likes break the site a bit. Just someting to look forward to... 

### NEW FEATURES 
Likes are a pain, we would need to implement an AJAX solution to make likes actualy work well. We may just scrap likes... we'll see. Following is similar to likes and would need an ajax responce to work well. We could implement these features under detail view but thats not as intuitive for the user. Edit post is the most feasable option for a new feature. Probaly the easiest to implement. Stay tuned.
