    - Allen and Jessica have done a great job at keeping code neat and readable
* Ensure test quality
    - Capture is working beautifully!
    - New features!
        * like posts
        * see who and how many people like your post
* Resolve all issues
    - load times are a bit slow but as of now there is not much we can do to speed things up
* Oversee release process
    - looked over Code.md and found that we would need to implement AJAX for a more stable version of "likes"
    - AJAX is needed to implement followers/following
