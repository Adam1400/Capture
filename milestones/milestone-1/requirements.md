## Book Builder - Project Charter

Book Builder is a software application that runs in the cloud and on mobile devices. 
Registered users can author materials for books being written.  Authors can create new
book projects, chapters, emedded images, and front matter.  

There are also tools that support the creative process for the author.  A complete content
outline can be used to generate the Table of Contents and all of the chapter structure. 
The software presents the chapters under development within an editorial process worflow.


### Business proposition

Author Value

Create the most productive tool for authors to write non-fiction books. Apply advanced
technology to allow authors to focus on the creative content, rather than the mechanical
process of computer and administrative work.

Business Value

Create application software that is capable of supporting a comercial publishing operation.
When this project is complete a business plan we be developed to get paying customers for
Book Builder.  The desire is to have an established company buy the Book Builder product.

Teaching Value

Book Builder will use the best practices in software engineering to teach students how
projects should be done.  This is include the entire software lifecyle, developer roles, 
and milestones.  The project has been divided into a grid of 28 cells 
(7 milestones x 4 roles).
Each cell in the matrix will have written documentation that can be a used as an example 
for other projects.


### Project scope & budget

#### Schedule, Money, Features

There are three primary priorities that define the scope of a software project.  It is 
important to establish the priority of each of these.  

Book Builder Priorities

1. Schedule - This entire must be completed by December 4, 2020 in order to be used for the
UNC classes.
2. Money - This project will be the individual work of Mark Seaman so no actual money will
be spent.  However, the budget can be measured in opportunity costs.  This project will
require about 100 hours of effort since many of the product features have been created for
other projects.  Mark's time is valued at $100/hour, making the project budget $10,000.
3. Features - Three teirs of features will be defined. Essential features define the 
Minimum Viable Product. Required features mark the Minimum Desirable Project.  Desired 
features define the Luxury Project.

Note the priorities - Schedule will never move, and Money will move only to protect 
the schedule.  Features will be adjusted throughout the milestone and must be constantly
negotiated with the client.


#### Project Features

Editorial Workflow

Each chapter goes through a series of stages:

* Outline - A strong outline fits into a master outline for the book.
* Draft - Each of the bullets in the outline is expanded into prose.
* Edit - The content is reviewed and updated for spelling, gramar, word choice, accuracy, 
and tone.
* Review - The content is ready to have external readers review it but remains in a
state of refinement.
* Published - The content is released to the public.

User Experience

Author can create book projects, outlines, chapters, text, images, cover artwork, and other
items needed for the book.

Kindle Book

At any time an HTML file and the assets needed can be generated from the content that the
author has created.  This HTML file can be directly uploaded to Amanzon as a Kindle book.

Reading Room

The ebook version of the content is displayed on the Book Builder website within the 
READING ROOM.  This offers a display showcase for authors to present their works and gives
reader an alternative to the Kindle book format.


### Teamwork

Development Team

The key to great teamwork is great communication.  This project is done by a mythical 
team of engineers:

* Mark Seaman - Technical lead
* Hank Pym - Back-end developer
* Bruce Banner - Front-end developer
* Tony Start - Project manager

Each person is given a role that matches their expertise. For each Milestone developers will
commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in the two-week 
Development Sprint.

Communication Plan

The dev team is geographically distributed in the USA, Japan, and Europe.
It is essential that developers meet up regularly over Zoom and occasionally in person.

The Book Builder team will meet MWF each week at 11:00-11:30 to coordinate 
project activities.  Development work will be done outside of this meeting.
This will serve the
purpose of the "Scrum Daily Stand-up Meeting".

Meeting Agenda

In this coordination each member will answer three questions.

* What did I do?
* What am I working on next?
* What challenges or risks are before me?

This meeting is for coordination only.  Developers should follow up and collaborate
later with each other when they see opportunities.

Team Coordination

Tony will lead the meetings as "Scrum Master".  His role as Project Manager makes him
the right person to lead the requirements effort.


### Scrum

Milestones

1. Project Plan Complete
2. Technology Proven
3. Core Features Implemented
4. Functionality Complete
5. Test Complete
6. Release
7. First Upgrade

Lifecycle

* Requirements - lead during Milestones 1-3
* Design - lead during Milestones 2-4
* Code - lead during Milestones 3-5
* Test  - lead during Milestones 5-7

Sprints

Each milestone represents a development sprint, which will be a highly focused burst 
of energy to meet the milestone goals.  Each sprint will last for two weeks.

During the Sprint developers will be building the next version of the product.  They will
be working on an explicit list of features designated by the client.  All other activities
will be postponed until the Sprint is complete.  Features that are planned cannot change 
during the Sprint.

Sprint Planning meetings

Each Sprint will start with a Sprint Planning Meeting.  Development team will meet with 
the client to determine the client features with the highest priority.  This will be 
expressed as a Product Backlog which shows the features in sorted order of importance to 
the client.

For each Milestone developers will
commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in the two-week 
Development Sprint.  Features are selected by the individual developer and must include 
the highest priority issues on the Product Backlog.

If a developer cannot deliver the required functionality then another teammate will be 
required to produce the missing result.
